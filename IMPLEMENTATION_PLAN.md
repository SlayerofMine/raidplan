# RaidPlans — Implementation Plan

A self-hosted web app for creating and sharing animated World of Warcraft raid/arena plans, deployed at **https://raidplans.mamzer.dev**. Authors drag predefined icons onto a map "canvas", arrange them, and animate them PowerPoint‑style (appear, disappear, fade, move) across steps. Guild members view the plans (read‑only) with playback controls.

This document is written so that a professional developer **or** another AI agent can follow it end‑to‑end. It is organised as **Phases → Steps**, each phase producing something runnable, with acceptance criteria.

> **Target environment.** Production runs on **Oracle Linux 10** (RHEL‑compatible: `dnf`, `systemd`, `firewalld`, SELinux enforcing) on an **Oracle Cloud Ampere A1 ARM** VM (`aarch64`). **Development requires Linux or WSL2** (Ubuntu recommended). Mind the arch split: the Vite frontend is architecture‑independent, but native modules (`better-sqlite3`) are built per‑platform — run `pnpm install`/build **on the ARM server itself** and never copy `node_modules` from an x64 dev box to the `aarch64` host.

---

## 1. Goals & Non‑Goals

**Goals**
- Nice‑looking, fast **canvas editor**: drag & drop predefined icons onto a map, move/resize/rotate, style, label.
- **PowerPoint‑style animation**: per‑object entrance/exit/emphasis/motion effects, organised into **steps** the viewer clicks through.
- **Viewer mode** for the guild: read‑only playback, step navigation, fullscreen, shareable links.
- **Self‑hostable** on the user's own box/domain, low‑ops, with backups.
- **Performs well with 50+ objects/animations** at ~60 fps.

**Non‑Goals (initially)**
- Real‑time multi‑user co‑editing (deferred to Phase 6).
- Mobile *authoring* (viewer is mobile‑friendly; editing targets desktop).
- Deep game integrations (combat log, WeakAuras) — future.

## 2. Key Decisions (made for you — all reversible)

| Decision | Choice | Why | Alternative |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rendering | **Konva** (`react-konva`) over Canvas 2D | Built for interactive 2D scene graphs: drag/drop, transformers, hit‑testing, layers; comfortably handles 50–500 objects | SVG (simpler, slower at scale) · PixiJS/WebGL (overkill now, use if 1000s) |
| Animation | **GSAP** timeline | Best‑in‑class sequencing = exactly the "PowerPoint" model; tweens any property incl. Konva nodes; free incl. MotionPath | Konva.Tween (weaker sequencing) · Motion/anime.js |
| Animation UX model | **Steps + per‑object animations** | Matches "click through slides, each with entrance/exit effects" mental model; simpler than a global keyframe timeline | Global keyframe timeline (more power, more complexity) |
| App shell | **React + Vite + TypeScript (SPA)** | Your stated preference; the hard part (canvas) is client‑side either way | Next.js (SSR share pages) — noted as drop‑in if you want server‑rendered previews |
| State | **Zustand + Immer + zundo** | Minimal, fast, selective re‑renders; easy undo/redo | Redux Toolkit (heavier) |
| Backend | **Node + Hono**, **tRPC** for app API, plain routes for public/share | End‑to‑end TypeScript, tiny footprint, easy to self‑host | Fastify + REST · Next.js API routes |
| DB | **SQLite** via **Drizzle ORM** (`better-sqlite3`, WAL mode) | Light traffic → one file, no DB server, trivial backups, sub‑ms reads | Postgres — only if you later add real‑time collab or outgrow a single writer |
| Auth | **better‑auth** + **Discord OAuth** | Guilds already live on Discord; one‑click login, gate by guild | Battle.net OAuth (bonus: roster import) · email magic‑link |
| Repo | **pnpm workspace monorepo** (`apps/web`, `apps/api`, `packages/shared`) | Share the Plan schema (zod) → end‑to‑end types | Single package (fine, less type‑sharing) |
| Infra | **systemd‑managed Node process + Caddy** on Oracle Linux 10 / ARM — no Docker | Runs the API directly on the VM; Caddy gives automatic HTTPS with near‑zero config; Node/Caddy/SQLite all have first‑class `aarch64` support | Docker (declined) · nginx + certbot |

> Per your calls: **SQLite** (light traffic) and **no Docker** — the API runs as a native process behind Caddy. The decisions still worth confirming before Phase 4: the **auth provider** (Discord vs Battle.net vs email), the **animation model** (steps vs full keyframe timeline), and the **WoW icon source** for the sync service (official Battle.net API vs CASC/TACT extraction vs a mirror — see §11.1). Everything else is easy to swap.

---

## 3. Recommended Tech Stack

**Frontend (`apps/web`)**
- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- `konva` + `react-konva` — canvas rendering
- `gsap` (+ MotionPathPlugin) — animation/playback engine
- `zustand` + `immer` + `zundo` — editor state, immutable updates, undo/redo
- `@tanstack/react-query` — server cache (pairs with tRPC)
- `react-router-dom` — routes (`/`, `/plan/:id/edit`, `/p/:slug`)
- `tailwindcss` + `shadcn/ui` (Radix) — UI components
- `zod` — validation (schemas shared from `packages/shared`)
- `@tanstack/react-virtual` — virtualize the icon palette

**Backend (`apps/api`)**
- Node 20+ / TypeScript, **Hono** HTTP server
- **tRPC** router (app API) + plain Hono routes (public share, OG image, exports, uploads)
- **Drizzle ORM** + **SQLite** (`better-sqlite3`, WAL mode) — embedded, no separate DB server
- **better-auth** (Discord OAuth), session cookies
- `satori` + `@resvg/resvg-js` — OG/preview image generation (preferred on ARM: prebuilt `aarch64` binaries, no system libs; avoid `node-canvas` unless you install its native deps)
- `pino` (logging), `zod` (validation)
- `sharp` (image resize → WebP; arm64 prebuilds) — icon sync pipeline (§11.1)

**Shared (`packages/shared`)**
- The **Plan schema** (zod + inferred TS types), effect/enums, and pure helpers (state resolution). Imported by both web and api.

**Tooling / Infra**
- **Dev environment: Linux or WSL2 required** (Ubuntu recommended); Node 20/22 LTS via `nvm`/`fnm` + `corepack` for pnpm
- pnpm workspaces, ESLint, Prettier, Husky + lint‑staged
- Vitest + React Testing Library (unit/component), Playwright (E2E)
- GitHub Actions (typecheck, lint, test, build web + api artifacts)
- **No Docker:** the API runs as a native process under **systemd** on Oracle Linux 10 (`aarch64`)
- Caddy (native RPM/binary, auto‑TLS for `raidplans.mamzer.dev`) — serves the built `web` and reverse‑proxies the API
- Backups: `litestream` (continuous) → **OCI Object Storage** (S3‑compatible) or a nightly SQLite online‑backup copied off‑box

## 4. High‑Level Architecture

  subgraph Browser["Browser SPA — React / Vite"]
    UI["Editor & Viewer UI (shadcn/Tailwind)"]
    Store["Zustand store (plan doc, selection)"]
    Canvas["Konva renderer (layers, nodes)"]
    Anim["GSAP playback engine"]
    UI --> Store --> Canvas

  end

  Caddy["Caddy — reverse proxy + TLS"]
  subgraph Server["Node — Hono"]

  Files[("Uploads volume / S3-compatible")]

  Browser --> Caddy --> Server
  Store <-->|react-query| TRPC
  TRPC --> DB
  REST --> DB
  Auth --> DB
  Server --> Files
```

**Golden rule for performance:** React/Zustand own the document while **editing**; during **playback**, GSAP mutates Konva node properties directly and calls `layer.batchDraw()` — **no React re‑render per frame**.

---

## 5. Core Data Model

The single source of truth is a **Plan document** (JSON), validated by a shared zod schema and stored in the DB.

```ts
// packages/shared/src/plan.ts  (sketch)
type Transform = { x: number; y: number; w: number; h: number; rotation: number };

type PlanObject = {
  id: string;
  type: 'token' | 'marker' | 'shape' | 'text' | 'arrow' | 'image';
  iconId?: string;                 // ref into the icon manifest
  base: Transform & {
    opacity: number;               // 0..1
    tint?: string;                 // class color / custom
    label?: string;
    z: number;                     // stacking order
    visible: boolean;
  };
  locked?: boolean;
};

type AnimEffect = 'appear' | 'disappear' | 'fade' | 'fly' | 'move' | 'scale' | 'pulse' | 'blink';
type AnimTrigger = 'onEnter' | 'withPrevious' | 'afterPrevious' | 'onClick';

type Anim = {
  id: string;
  objectId: string;
  kind: 'entrance' | 'exit' | 'emphasis' | 'motion';
  effect: AnimEffect;
  trigger: AnimTrigger;
  delayMs: number;
  durationMs: number;
  easing: string;                  // GSAP ease name
  params?: { toX?: number; toY?: number; toOpacity?: number; path?: {x:number;y:number}[] };
};

type Step = {
  id: string;
  name?: string;
  // End-state deltas applied to objects when this step is "settled":
  overrides: Record<string /*objectId*/, Partial<Transform & { opacity: number; visible: boolean }>>;
  animations: Anim[];
  autoAdvanceMs?: number;          // optional autoplay
};

type Plan = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  raid: string;                    // encounter/map id
  background: { assetId: string; width: number; height: number }; // native coords
  objects: PlanObject[];           // base object set (exists across steps)
  steps: Step[];                   // ordered "slides"
  schemaVersion: number;           // for migrations
};
```

**Coordinate system:** store all positions in the background's **native pixel space** (resolution‑independent). The Konva `Stage` is scaled to fit the container, so plans look identical on any screen.

**State resolution (pure function in `shared`):** given `objects` + previous step's settled state + current `step.overrides/animations`, compute the **start state** and **end state** for every object. The editor edits the end state; the viewer animates start→end. This is the "PowerPoint slide + animations" model, kept deterministic and testable.

**Persistence schema (SQLite, Drizzle):**
```
users(id, discord_id UNIQUE, name, avatar_url, created_at)
guilds(id, name, discord_guild_id)
memberships(user_id, guild_id, role /* owner|editor|viewer */, PRIMARY KEY(user_id,guild_id))
plans(id, slug UNIQUE, owner_id, guild_id, title, raid,
      visibility /* private|unlisted|public */, thumbnail_url,
      created_at, updated_at, deleted_at NULL)
plan_data(plan_id PK/FK, schema_version, doc TEXT, updated_at)   -- current document
plan_versions(id, plan_id, doc TEXT, created_at)                 -- optional history (Phase 6)
assets(id, owner_id, kind /* background|icon|upload */, url, width, height, created_at)
```
> The whole Plan lives as one **JSON text** blob (`plan_data.doc`, stored as `TEXT`; SQLite's JSON1 functions can query inside it if ever needed). It's small (tens of KB even with 50+ objects), trivial to load/save atomically, and versionable. Relational columns exist only for listing, access control, and search.

---

## 6. Canvas & Rendering Design

- **Layers (few, purposeful):** (1) background image, (2) interactive objects, (3) transformer/handles + selection UI, (4) transient overlays (alignment guides). Each Konva layer = one `<canvas>`; keep the count small.
- **Objects → nodes:** each `PlanObject` maps to a Konva node (`Image` for icons, `Rect/Circle/Arrow/Line/Text` for primitives). A React component per object via `react-konva`, keyed by id.
- **Interaction:** drag to move; `Konva.Transformer` for resize/rotate on selection; click/shift‑click multi‑select; marquee select; delete/duplicate; arrow‑key nudge; snap to grid + alignment guides.
- **Pan & zoom:** wheel zoom to cursor, space‑drag pan; clamp scale; fit‑to‑screen button. Store pan/zoom in view state (not in the plan doc).
- **Icon rendering:** preload each icon `Image` once into a cache keyed by `iconId`; reuse across all nodes. Consider a **sprite atlas** (single texture) for the palette + tokens to cut HTTP requests and memory.
- **Tokens:** composite node = icon + optional class‑color ring + name label; cache with `.cache()` so it draws as one bitmap.

---

## 7. Animation & Playback Design

**Authoring**
- Right‑panel "Animations" list for the **current step**: add per object, pick **kind** (entrance/exit/emphasis/motion) → **effect** (appear/fade/fly/move/scale/pulse/blink) → **trigger** (on enter / with previous / after previous / on click) → duration, delay, easing.
- **Motion** effects: drag a path on canvas (array of points) → animate along it (GSAP MotionPathPlugin).
- Live "Preview step" button re‑runs the timeline.

**Playback engine** (`apps/web/src/anim/`)
- On entering a step: read its `animations`, sort/compose into a **GSAP timeline**:
  - `withPrevious` → same start time; `afterPrevious` → appended; `onEnter` → at t=0; `onClick` → separate timeline advanced by click.
- Tween the **Konva node attributes** (`x, y, opacity, scaleX/Y, rotation`) directly; on each tick call `layer.batchDraw()`. **Do not** route frames through React.
- Controls: play / pause / restart / next‑step / prev‑step / scrub (seek the timeline) / speed. Keyboard: ←/→ steps, space play/pause.
- Entering a step first **snaps** all objects to that step's start state, then plays to the end state, so navigation is always consistent regardless of where you jump from.

**Viewer mode** reuses the same engine, read‑only, with a clean control bar, fullscreen, optional autoplay (`autoAdvanceMs`), and click/keyboard advance.

---

## 8. Performance Strategy (50+ objects & animations)

Design targets: **60 fps** playback and drag with 50–100 objects; graceful to a few hundred.

1. **Never re‑render React during animation.** GSAP mutates Konva nodes + `batchDraw()`. React only re‑renders on structural edits.
2. **Normalized store + fine‑grained selectors.** Zustand selectors so moving one object doesn't re‑render the other 49. Use `shallow` equality.
3. **Layer discipline.** Static background on its own layer (drawn once). Keep total layers ≤ 4. Redraw only the interactive layer during drag/playback.
4. **Node hygiene:** on static/non‑interactive nodes set `listening(false)`; disable `perfectDrawEnabled(false)` and `shadowForStrokeEnabled(false)`; avoid shadows/filters on many nodes (they force expensive redraws). `.cache()` composite tokens to a bitmap.
5. **Image caching / sprite atlas.** One `Image` per icon, reused; atlas to reduce draw calls and requests.
6. **Batch the timeline.** One GSAP timeline per step (not 50 independent tweens firing setState). GSAP already syncs to a single rAF.
7. **Virtualize the palette** (`react-virtual`) — hundreds of icons render only what's visible.
8. **Debounced autosave** (e.g. 1–2 s idle) with structural sharing (Immer); never serialize on every drag tick.
9. **Undo/redo** via Immer patches (zundo) — snapshotting 50 objects is cheap; store patches, not full copies.
10. **Escape hatch:** if you ever need thousands of nodes or particle‑like effects, swap the render layer to **PixiJS/WebGL** behind the same store/engine interface. The data model and animation engine stay unchanged.
11. **Measure:** add an FPS meter + Konva `Stage` draw stats in dev; profile a 50‑object, 4‑step plan each phase.

---

## 9. Backend & API

- **tRPC router** (auth‑gated app API):
  - `plan.create`, `plan.list` (by guild/owner), `plan.get`, `plan.saveDoc` (debounced autosave, optimistic), `plan.rename`, `plan.duplicate`, `plan.setVisibility`, `plan.softDelete`.
  - `me.get`, `guild.members`.
- **Plain Hono routes** (public / non‑tRPC):
  - `GET /p/:slug` → serves the viewer HTML with **OG meta tags** (Discord unfurl).
  - `GET /p/:slug/og.png` → server‑rendered preview of step 1 (satori/resvg or konva‑node).
  - `GET /api/plan/:slug/export.png?step=n` → PNG export.
  - `POST /api/upload` → background/image upload (auth’d, validated).
- **Access control:** `private` = requires guild membership; `unlisted` = anyone with slug; `public` = listed. Enforce in a tRPC middleware + on public routes.
- **Validation:** every input parsed with the shared zod schemas. Rate‑limit uploads and writes.

---

## 10. Auth & Sharing

- **better‑auth** with **Discord OAuth**. On first login, create `user`; map the user to your guild via a configured `discord_guild_id` (optionally verify membership through Discord's API). Roles: owner/editor/viewer.
- Session cookies (httpOnly, SameSite=Lax, Secure in prod).
- **Sharing:** each plan has a short `slug`; the viewer route works for `unlisted`/`public` without login; `private` requires a session + membership.
- **Discord previews:** the OG image + title/description make pasted links unfurl nicely in the guild's Discord — a high‑value, low‑cost feature.
- **Optional Battle.net OAuth** (Phase 6): pull the guild roster to auto‑generate player tokens with class colors.

---

## 11. Asset / Icon Pipeline

Two distinct icon sources feed the palette:

- **A. Bundled app icons** (shipped in the repo, versioned): raid target markers (skull/cross/square/moon/star/circle/diamond/triangle), generic shapes (circle/rect/cone/line/arrow), role icons (tank/heal/dps), UI glyphs. Small, curated, original or clearly‑licensed art. Manifest `{ id, category, name, file, tags[] }` → packed into a **sprite atlas** for the palette + tokens.
- **B. Synced WoW icon catalog** (dynamic, refreshable): the large native library of spell/ability/item/class/spec icons, kept current with the live game by the **Icon Sync Service** (§11.1). Served from our own storage, searched via an API, referenced from plans by stable id.
- **Backgrounds:** curated arena/dungeon/raid maps bundled as assets, selectable via the raid/map picker; plus user uploads (Phase 4).
- **Build step:** generate a **sprite atlas** + preload list from the manifest.
- **⚠️ Licensing:** WoW icons/maps are **Blizzard's IP** — see the licensing note at the end of §11.1 for how each source is handled.

### 11.1 WoW Native Icon Sync Service

**Goal:** a refreshable catalog of the icons that exist in WoW, sourced from WoW itself, stored on our infra, exposed to the palette through a search API — with a `POST` endpoint (and a scheduled timer) that "refreshes" the catalog whenever Blizzard ships a new build.

**Two-source model.** The **index** (which icons exist) comes from the community **listfile** (wowdev's `community-listfile.csv`, filtered to `interface/icons/`) — it maps `FileDataID → name` (`spell_fire_fireball02`, `inv_sword_04`, …), is just a text file, and updates every patch. The **image bytes** come from a pluggable **Source Adapter** (below). Plans reference the **stable id**; the adapter is an implementation detail.

**Pipeline**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Trigger["POST /api/admin/icons/sync  or  systemd timer"] --> Ver
  Ver["Detect current WoW build (TACT/Ribbit or wago.tools)"] -->|unchanged and not forced| Noop["no-op"]
  Ver -->|new build| List["Fetch listfile, filter interface icons"]
  List --> Diff["Diff vs catalog by FileDataID and content hash"]
  Diff --> Fetch["For new or changed: fetch image via Source Adapter"]
  Fetch --> Conv["Convert to WebP at 56 and 112 px (sharp)"]
  Conv --> Store["Upload to OCI Object Storage, content-hashed URL"]
  Store --> Upsert["Upsert icons row; mark missing as deprecated"]
  Upsert --> Record["Write icon_sync_runs record"]
```

**Source adapter (pluggable — pick per environment):**

| Adapter | What it is | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Battle.net API + Media** | Official Game Data + `/media/...` endpoints | Licensed for non‑commercial fan use (with attribution); clean id↔icon mapping | Keyed by entity (item/spell/…), no bulk "all icons" list; needs a client id/secret |
| **Blizzard CDN via TACT/CASC** | Extract BLP textures from Blizzard's CDN for the live build | Authoritative, complete, auto‑updates per patch — the "proper" way | Most work: TACT/CASC + BLP→WebP; JS tooling is weak (C#/Python/Go stronger — shell out, or use `wow.export`/CascLib) |
| **Mirror / wago.tools** | Community datamining site: build info + file access | Simple bulk import; already decoded | Depends on a third party staying current |
| **Wowhead CDN (by name)** | `wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/{name}.jpg` | Trivial per‑name fetch | Hotlinking is against Wowhead's wishes → **cache into our store, never hotlink at runtime** |

**Recommended strategy:** code against a small `IconSource` interface and run **two sources**: (1) **Battle.net API** for the *curated* sets — classes, specs, roles, and any spell/item resolved by id (ships in Phase 2's palette); (2) a **bulk source** for the giant searchable library — start with the *simplest* (mirror/wago.tools or cached Wowhead‑by‑name), keep **TACT/CASC** as the fully‑automated‑per‑patch upgrade. Swapping the bulk source later changes **no plan data and no frontend code**.

**Names → categories & search.** Tokenise the listfile name on `_` to derive a rough **category** (`spell` / `ability` / `inv`→item / `achievement` / `class` / `trade` …) and **search tags** ("fire", "sword", "frost"). Powers palette search with zero manual tagging.

**Catalog schema (SQLite, Drizzle):**
```
icons(id TEXT PK,            -- stable slug = icon name, e.g. "spell_fire_fireball02"
      file_data_id INTEGER,  -- WoW FileDataID (nullable for non-CASC sources)
      display_name, category, tags TEXT,   -- tags = JSON array
      url_56 TEXT, url_112 TEXT,            -- our storage URLs (content-hashed, immutable)
      content_hash, source,                -- source = 'bnet' | 'tact' | 'pack' | 'wowhead'
      first_seen_build, deprecated INTEGER DEFAULT 0, updated_at)
icon_sync_runs(id, started_at, finished_at, build, added, updated, removed, status, error)
```

**Endpoints**
- `POST /api/admin/icons/sync` — **admin/owner‑gated**; kicks off the job **async** (returns `{ runId }` — a first full pull can run minutes). Body: `{ force?: boolean, source?: 'bnet' | 'tact' | ... }`.
- `GET /api/admin/icons/sync/:runId` — run status/progress.
- `GET /api/icons?query=&category=&cursor=` — the palette's search/paginate feed (guild‑readable); returns `{ id, display_name, category, url_56 }[]` + cursor. **Never** dumps 40k rows.
- Images are static objects on OCI Object Storage / behind Caddy — immutable, long `Cache-Control`.

**Refresh detection & scheduling.** A **systemd timer** (e.g. weekly) hits the same job; it first reads the current build (TACT/Ribbit or wago.tools) and **no‑ops if unchanged** unless `force`. Diffs are **incremental**, so steady‑state refreshes fetch only the handful of icons a patch adds/changes.

**Stability contract (important).** Plans store the **stable icon id** (name/FileDataID), never a URL. Deprecated/removed icons are **retained** (flagged) so historical plans never break. Content‑hashed URLs let browser + CDN cache aggressively.

**Frontend integration.** The palette is a **virtualised grid** backed by `GET /api/icons` (server search + pagination), images `loading="lazy"`. Opening a plan resolves only the ids it actually uses and warms the Konva image cache for those.

**Sizing.** ~40k icons as 56px WebP ≈ a few KB each → well under ~200 MB total; trivial on OCI Object Storage. A curated subset (spell/ability/class/spec) is far smaller.

**⚠️ Licensing (per source).** WoW icons are **Blizzard's IP**. The **official Battle.net API** is the cleanest path (non‑commercial fan use with attribution — per Blizzard's API ToS). CASC/TACT extraction and Wowhead caching are community‑standard datamining but are still Blizzard's assets: keep the tool **private/guild‑gated**, **cache into your own storage** (don't hammer or hotlink third parties at runtime), add **attribution**, and **don't publicly redistribute** the icon pack. Prefer the official API wherever it covers what you need.

## 12. Implementation Phases

Estimates assume **one experienced full‑stack dev**; scale accordingly. Every phase ends in a runnable, demoable state.

### Phase 0 — Foundations (≈ 2–4 days)
- **0.1** Init pnpm monorepo: `apps/web`, `apps/api`, `packages/shared`; strict TS, path aliases.
- **0.2** Tooling: ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, Playwright, Husky + lint‑staged.
- **0.3** CI (GitHub Actions): install → typecheck → lint → test → build.
- **0.4** Native run setup on the ARM VM: a **systemd** unit for the API + a Caddy config serving a placeholder page over HTTPS — prove the no‑Docker deploy path early (incl. firewalld + the OCI security‑list ingress rules).
- **0.5** DNS/TLS + network: point `raidplans.mamzer.dev` at the VM's public IP; open TCP **80/443 in BOTH the OCI VCN security list AND firewalld**; Caddyfile with automatic TLS; document.
- **0.6** Draft the shared **Plan zod schema** in `packages/shared` — the contract everything else builds on.
- **Acceptance:** `pnpm dev` runs empty web+api; CI green; Caddy serves a placeholder over HTTPS with the API running under the process manager.

### Phase 1 — Canvas MVP, no backend (≈ 3–5 days)
- **1.1** Vite React shell: routing, Tailwind, editor layout (toolbar / left palette / center canvas / right panel / bottom strip).
- **1.2** Konva `Stage`/`Layer`; virtual‑coordinate space + fit‑to‑container scaling; wheel zoom + space‑pan.
- **1.3** Render a background map image on the background layer.
- **1.4** Zustand store: normalized `objects`; add / select / move / delete.
- **1.5** Objects as Konva images: drag to move, click to select, Delete to remove.
- **1.6** Minimal palette (5–10 hardcoded icons) → click/drag to add.
- **Acceptance:** add 10 icons, drag smoothly, delete; positions stable across zoom/resize.

### Phase 2 — Full single‑board editor, local persistence (≈ 1–2 weeks)
- **2.1** Asset pipeline: bundled markers/shapes/role icons (manifest + **sprite atlas**) **plus** a curated WoW class/spec icon set (Battle.net API or bundled); preloaded image cache; searchable, **virtualized** palette. *(The full synced catalog lands in 4.9 — the palette API is designed for it now.)*
- **2.2** `Konva.Transformer`: resize/rotate handles; rotation snap; aspect constraints.
- **2.3** Properties panel: x/y, size, rotation, opacity, tint, label, lock, z‑order.
- **2.4** Primitive tools: text labels; shapes (rect/circle/cone); freehand/anchored **arrows & movement paths**.
- **2.5** Player tokens (class‑color ring + role + name) and raid markers.
- **2.6** Editing UX: grid + snapping, alignment guides, multi‑select, group move, copy/paste/duplicate, layer ordering, lock/hide.
- **2.7** Undo/redo (zundo/Immer patches) + keyboard shortcuts.
- **2.8** Local persistence: serialize plan → JSON; localStorage autosave; import/export `.json`.
- **2.9** Map/raid selector from the bundled background set.
- **Acceptance:** build a 30‑token board, adjust every property, undo/redo works, export→import round‑trips, autosave restores after reload.

### Phase 3 — Animation & Steps (≈ 1–2 weeks)
- **3.1** Extend schema: `steps[]` with per‑step `overrides` + `animations`; migrate local persistence.
- **3.2** Steps strip UI: add / duplicate / reorder (drag) / delete steps; per‑step thumbnails; "editing step N".
- **3.3** Pure **state resolution** (start/end per object per step) in `shared`, with unit tests.
- **3.4** Animation authoring UI: add/edit animations (kind → effect → trigger → delay/duration/easing); motion‑path drawing.
- **3.5** **GSAP playback engine**: compile a step into a timeline; tween Konva nodes; `batchDraw`; play/pause/scrub/step nav; **no React re‑render per frame**.
- **3.6** Viewer mode (read‑only): control bar, step nav, fullscreen, optional autoplay, keyboard/click advance.
- **3.7** **Performance pass**: layer strategy, node caching, disable shadows/listening on static, atlas, FPS meter; hit 60 fps with 50 objects / 4 steps.
- **Acceptance:** a 4‑step, 50‑object plan plays at ~60 fps; scrubbing and jump‑to‑step are consistent; viewer navigates cleanly.

### Phase 4 — Backend, auth, persistence, sharing (≈ 1–2 weeks)
- **4.1** `apps/api` Hono app + tRPC router; Drizzle + **SQLite** (`better-sqlite3`, WAL + `busy_timeout`); migrations.
- **4.2** DB schema (users, guilds, memberships, plans, plan_data, assets).
- **4.3** Auth: better‑auth + Discord OAuth; sessions; guild gating; roles.
- **4.4** Plan CRUD wired to the editor: create/list/load; **debounced optimistic autosave**; rename/duplicate/soft‑delete.
- **4.5** Visibility (private/unlisted/public) + share slugs + access checks.
- **4.6** Public viewer route `/p/:slug` (no login for unlisted/public).
- **4.7** OG preview image (server render of step 1) + meta tags for **Discord unfurl**.
- **4.8** Uploads: custom backgrounds → local volume or S3/MinIO; validation & limits.
- **4.9** WoW Icon Sync Service (§11.1): `icons` + `icon_sync_runs` tables; pluggable `IconSource` adapter (Battle.net API for curated sets; TACT/CASC or a pack for bulk); `POST /api/admin/icons/sync` (async, admin‑gated) + `GET /api/icons` search feed; BLP/JPG→WebP via `sharp`; upload to OCI Object Storage; **systemd timer** for scheduled refresh with incremental build diffing; deprecated‑icon retention.
- **Acceptance:** two guild members log in via Discord; one creates & shares a plan; the other views it; the link unfurls in Discord. A `POST /api/admin/icons/sync` run populates the WoW icon catalog and the palette searches it.

### Phase 5 — Polish, export, deploy (≈ 1 week)
- **5.1** Export: PNG per step (`toDataURL`); optional animated export (canvas `captureStream` → WebM) as nice‑to‑have.
- **5.2** Dashboard: plan list with thumbnails/search/tags; templates & duplication; starter plans.
- **5.3** Mobile‑friendly viewer; responsive tweaks; accessibility pass (keyboard nav, ARIA on panels/dialogs).
- **5.4** Error handling, empty states, toasts, skeletons; logging (pino) + basic metrics; optional Sentry.
- **5.5** Hardening: zod validation everywhere, authz tests, rate limiting, session/CSRF security, upload safety.
- **5.6** Production deploy on Oracle Linux 10 / ARM (no Docker): build `web` → static; run the API under **systemd**; **Caddy** (RPM) for TLS + static + reverse proxy; firewalld + OCI security‑list rules; SELinux contexts as needed; env/secrets; **SQLite backups** via `litestream` → OCI Object Storage (+ uploads); `/healthz`; documented update & restore runbook.
- **Acceptance:** fresh deploy reproducible from the runbook; backup+restore verified; a 50‑object plan is smooth in production at `https://raidplans.mamzer.dev`.

### Phase 6 — Future / optional
- Real‑time collaboration (Yjs + `y-websocket`, presence/cursors).
- Comments/annotations; plan version history + diff.
- Battle.net OAuth + **guild roster import** (auto‑create class‑colored player tokens).
- Boss ability timers / imported cooldown timelines.
- Community template library; cloning; reactions; i18n; PDF/print export.

## 13. Testing & QA

- **Unit (Vitest):** state resolution, schema validation/migrations, animation timeline compilation, store reducers, access‑control helpers.
- **Component (RTL):** palette, properties panel, steps strip, animation editor.
- **E2E (Playwright):** create → place → animate → save → open viewer → play; auth flow; sharing/visibility; import/export round‑trip.
  - **Testing protected flows without Discord:** the API's `DEV_AUTH` flag (dev/CI only — `loadConfig` refuses it in production) exposes `/api/dev/login?userId=…`, which mints a session cookie for any user. Being an admin comes from `ICON_ADMIN_USER_IDS`, so dev‑login as an allowlisted id to reach admin routes. For manual work: `pnpm dev:auth`, then visit `/api/dev/login?userId=me`. For E2E: the signed‑in suite (`pnpm --filter @raidplan/web test:e2e:auth`, config `playwright.auth.config.ts`) boots a throwaway API (in‑memory DB, `DEV_AUTH`) and a `signIn()` helper — kept separate so the default suite stays hermetic.
- **Performance:** scripted 50‑object/4‑step scene with an FPS assertion in CI (allow a threshold) to catch regressions.
- **Manual QA checklist** per release: zoom/pan, snapping, undo/redo depth, keyboard shortcuts, mobile viewer, Discord unfurl.

---

## 14. Deployment & Ops

- **Target:** Oracle Linux 10 (RHEL‑compatible) on an Oracle Cloud Ampere A1 ARM VM (`aarch64`; free tier gives up to 4 OCPU / 24 GB — ample). Node, Caddy, SQLite, and litestream all ship first‑class arm64 builds.
- **Topology (no Docker):** **Caddy** (native, TLS + reverse proxy) serves the built `web` static files and proxies `/api`, `/trpc`, `/p/*` to the Node API on `localhost:4000`; the API is a **systemd** service; **SQLite** is a file on local disk (WAL mode); uploads live in a local directory (or OCI Object Storage). No database server, no containers. *(Option: let Hono serve the static files too, so Caddy is only a TLS front.)*
- **One‑time install:** Node 20/22 LTS (`nvm`/`fnm` or NodeSource) + `corepack enable` (pnpm); build tools so `better-sqlite3` can compile if no arm64 prebuilt matches your Node ABI — `sudo dnf group install "Development Tools"` + `python3`; Caddy from its official RPM repo (`sudo dnf install caddy`), which brings an arm64 binary and a systemd unit.
- **Networking — two layers (classic Oracle gotcha):** open TCP **80 and 443** in BOTH (1) the **OCI VCN security list / NSG** (Cloud console) and (2) instance **firewalld** — `sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http --add-service=https && sudo firewall-cmd --reload`. Missing either breaks ACME/TLS.
- **SELinux (enforcing — keep it):** label the web root (`sudo semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t "/srv/web(/.*)?" && sudo restorecon -R /srv/web`); if the Caddy→API proxy is denied, `sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect on`. Diagnose denials with `sudo ausearch -m avc -ts recent`.
- **API service:** a `raidplans-api.service` systemd unit — `ExecStart=/usr/bin/node apps/api/dist/server.js`, `EnvironmentFile=/etc/raidplans/env`, `User=raidplans`, `Restart=on-failure`; `sudo systemctl enable --now raidplans-api`.
- **Caddyfile (essence):** `raidplans.mamzer.dev { encode gzip; reverse_proxy /api/* localhost:4000; reverse_proxy /trpc/* localhost:4000; reverse_proxy /p/* localhost:4000; root * /srv/web; file_server }` — automatic TLS via Let's Encrypt (requires 80/443 reachable per above).
- **SQLite tuning:** WAL mode + `busy_timeout` (~5 s) so reads never block the single writer; `better-sqlite3` is synchronous and sub‑millisecond for these tiny JSON reads/writes.
- **Config/secrets:** `/etc/raidplans/env` (SQLite path, Discord id/secret, session secret, base URL), `chmod 600`, never committed.
- **Backups:** the DB is one file — **litestream** replicates it continuously to **OCI Object Storage** (S3‑compatible endpoint; same cloud, cheap) *or* a nightly `sqlite3 app.db '.backup backup.db'` copied off‑box. Also back up the uploads dir. **Test restore before go‑live.**
- **Updates:** on the VM — `git pull` → `pnpm install` (rebuilds arm64 native modules) → `pnpm build` → `sudo systemctl restart raidplans-api`; `sudo systemctl reload caddy` if its config changed. **Never** copy `node_modules` from an x64 dev box to the arm64 host.
- **Observability:** pino → journald (`journalctl -u raidplans-api -f`), a `/healthz` endpoint, an external uptime check; optional Sentry for the SPA.

## 15. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Jank with many animated objects | Imperative GSAP↔Konva (no per‑frame React), layer discipline, caching, FPS meter in CI (Phase 3.7 / §8) |
| Asset licensing (Blizzard IP) | Keep it private/non‑commercial; source‑attributed swappable manifest; prefer Battle.net media / CC art (§11) |
| Animation model too limited later | Data model already supports triggers/paths; can graduate to a full keyframe timeline without changing storage |
| Self‑host maintenance burden | No Docker: one systemd‑managed Node process + Caddy auto‑TLS + single‑file SQLite + documented runbook & automated backups keep ops minimal |
| ARM / Oracle Linux specifics | `aarch64` is first‑class for Node/Caddy/SQLite/litestream; install "Development Tools" so `better-sqlite3` can build; mind the **dual firewall** (OCI security list + firewalld) and **SELinux** — all covered in §14 |
| SQLite write contention | WAL mode + `busy_timeout`; a single writer is fine at guild scale and the JSON‑blob writes are tiny and debounced. Only revisit (→ Postgres) if you add real‑time collab (Phase 6) |
| Scope creep | Phases are independently shippable; collaboration/extras are explicitly Phase 6 |
| Data loss on autosave races | Debounced optimistic writes with a `version`/`updated_at` check; last‑write‑wins is acceptable single‑editor, revisit for Phase 6 collab |

## 16. First‑Week Concrete Tasks (quick start)

1. `pnpm init` workspace; scaffold `apps/web` (Vite React TS), `apps/api` (Hono), `packages/shared`.
2. Add Tailwind + shadcn to `web`; lay out the 5‑region editor shell.
3. Drop in Konva: render a background image, place one draggable icon, wire a Zustand store.
4. Write the first cut of the **Plan zod schema** in `shared` and make the store use it.
5. Add ESLint/Prettier/Vitest + a GitHub Actions CI that typechecks and tests.
6. On the ARM VM: install Node + Caddy, open 80/443 (OCI security list *and* firewalld), and serve a placeholder over HTTPS under **systemd** — prove the no‑Docker deploy path early.

Deliver Phase 1's acceptance criteria by end of week 1; you now have a spine to hang everything else on.

## 17. Encounter Presets & Attack Designer (epic)

An **admin panel** with two jobs, plus the matching planner-side flow. Decisions
taken with the maintainer; see the memory note `encounter-attack-designer`.

- **Encounter presets** — admin defines *raid → encounter → { background, curated
  token roster, optional pre-placed objects }*. The planner picks a raid + encounter
  and gets a pre-seeded plan. A preset is essentially a template `Plan`; a new plan
  clones its preset content.
- **Attack designer** — admin pre-designs *attacks* (multi-object animated mechanics)
  per encounter. The planner drops one in and only adjusts **position + timing**; an
  attack is an **indivisible** unit (can't be dismantled or hand-animated).

**Key architecture decisions**

- **Attacks use a reference / instance model, not baked groups.** A plan stores only an
  `AttackInstance { attackId, version, x, y, rotation, scale, startMs, params }`; the
  internals live in an `AttackDef` authored in the designer. A shared
  `expandStep(step, defs) → { objects, anims }` (beside `resolveObjectState`) is the one
  place instances become concrete, and Konva, the OG SVG renderer and the WebM exporter
  all consume its output — so they can't diverge. Indivisibility is a property of the
  data: there is nothing in the plan doc to select.
- **Backgrounds are admin-uploaded original battlemaps** (no Blizzard art — keeps the §11
  stance). Reuses the existing upload pipeline (`assets.kind = "background"`,
  `isUploadedAsset`, `/uploads/…`); an encounter references the uploaded `assetId`.
- Attack instances live **per step**: `Step` gains `attacks: AttackInstance[]` alongside
  `animations`. The designer *is* the existing editor, admin-scoped, plus marking the
  anchor object and which values are exposed knobs.
- Admin gating: an `adminProcedure` generalizing `isIconAdmin(viewer, adminUserIds)` over
  the same allowlist.

**Open decision (before Stage 3):** when an admin edits an attack def, do dependent plans
auto-follow the latest version or stay pinned? Leaning auto-follow + a visible "updated"
marker for v1; add pinning later.

**Stages** (each independently shippable, green per commit)

1. **Encounter registry + preset → new-plan flow.** `EncounterPreset` schema in shared;
   `encounters` table + repo + idempotent seed; `encounter.list`; `plan.create` accepts an
   `encounterId` and seeds the doc from the preset; the home page's new-plan control becomes
   an encounter selector (grouped by raid), with the bundled maps kept as a fallback. Seeds
   re-express today's three bundled maps as a "Sandbox" raid so there's no regression and no
   dependency on an icon sync. *(Roster curation of the left palette is a follow-up slice —
   it needs the plan to reference its encounter and touches the icon palette.)*
2. **`adminProcedure` + admin panel shell** [DONE] — CRUD encounters and upload
   battlemaps at `/admin`, gated by a site-admin allowlist. *(Roster curation is
   deferred with the left-palette work; the panel edits name/raid/background.)*
3. **`AttackDef`/`AttackInstance` schema + `expandPlan` wired into the renderers** [DONE] —
   the architectural core. A plan stores only instances; the pure `expandPlan(plan, defs)`
   stamps them into an ordinary Plan (namespaced objects, per-step visibility overrides,
   transformed anims), so every renderer draws attacks for free. Wired into the OG preview
   (server) and the viewer (Konva). *Auto-follow* by `attackId`. WebM inherits attacks once
   the editor renders placed instances (stage 5), since it captures that stage. v1 def
   effects are the params-driven set; `scale`/`fly`-to-target need a def end-state (follow-up).
4. **Attack designer** [DONE] — the editor, admin-scoped. An `AttackDef` is a one-step
   mini-plan, so `defToPlan`/`planToAttackContent` load it onto the shared store and the same
   canvas/palette/panels author it; a **Layout | Animate** toggle switches between base
   placement and the single step's end-state + animations. Admin attack CRUD
   (`attack.create/update/remove/get`) behind `adminProcedure`; `/admin/encounters/:id/attacks`
   lists and the designer saves. Verified by a signed-in e2e. *(Custom exposed knobs beyond
   position/rotation/scale/timing, and an interactive on-canvas anchor handle, are follow-ups —
   the anchor is set numerically for now.)*
5. **Planner side** [MOSTLY DONE] — `Plan.encounterId` records which encounter seeded a plan,
   so the editor offers *that* encounter's attacks. Store actions place/retune/remove instances,
   and an Attacks panel drops one on the current step and tunes x/y, rotation, scale and start
   offset. Placed attacks already render in the **viewer** and the **share preview** (stage 3).
   **Remaining:** an in-editor canvas preview of a placed attack. `ObjectNode` resolves what it
   draws from the store, so it can't draw an attack's *expanded* (ephemeral) objects; that needs
   its drawing split from its selection/drag behaviour. The same change lets the **WebM export**
   — which captures the live editor stage — include attacks. Until then the planner positions
   numerically and checks the result in the viewer.

---

## 18. Groups, and the attack library rebuilt around them

§17 shipped attacks end-to-end, but the authoring/placing UX was wrong: attacks lived in a
right-hand panel tuned by typing numbers, definitions were authored in absolute pixels, and
`collideWith` was baked into a definition that cannot know a plan's objects. This section
rebuilds that on a **grouping** primitive.

**Three findings make this cheaper than it looks.** `SelectionTransformer` already attaches to
*multiple* nodes and `ObjectNode` already folds per-node scale back into `w`/`h`, so rigid
multi-object transform exists today; the left palette already has tabs and a drag payload; and
`ObjectVisual` is already a store-free renderer.

**Decisions taken (user):** placing an attack keeps it a **live reference** (indivisible,
auto-following) that merely *behaves* like a group; definitions are authored in **-1..1 centred**
unit space; and there is **no migration** — the schema changes outright (bump `SCHEMA_VERSION`).

### 18.1 Grouping

`PlanObject.groupId?` — a group exists when ≥2 objects share one; an optional `Plan.groups`
record holds names. The feature is mostly **selection resolution**: clicking a member selects
every member, and because `selectedIds` already drives the multi-node transformer, rigid
move/scale/rotate comes for free. Group/ungroup are two store actions; members stay contiguous
in z-order. Double-click-to-enter is a later nicety.

### 18.2 Attacks in unit space; instances as rects

- Definition content — object positions **and** sizes, plus animation `toX`/`toY` and paths — is
  authored in **-1..1 centred** unit space. Nothing absolute.
- An instance becomes a **rect**: `{ x, y, w, h, rotation, startMs, args }`. `scale` and `anchor`
  disappear; the rect *is* the placement, which is exactly what a Konva `Transformer` edits.
- Expansion maps `plan = centre + unit × (size/2)`, then rotates about the rect centre. Lengths
  scale by `w/2` and `h/2` independently, so non-uniform resize stretches an attack — Shift
  preserves aspect.
- **Codified constraint:** a definition is exactly *base state + one step*.

### 18.3 Attacks as canvas citizens

Each instance renders as a Konva `Group` (id = instance id, draggable) whose expanded children are
drawn read-only through `ObjectVisual`. It joins selection and the transformer, so it is moved,
scaled and rotated like any object — but never entered, because it is indivisible. This **removes
the numeric `AttacksPanel`**; only timing and parameters remain in a properties panel.

### 18.4 Parameters

A definition declares `params: [{ key, label, type, default }]` over
`objectRefs | number | color | text | boolean`; an instance supplies `args`. Internals bind through
**typed slots** rather than a template language (an animation's `collideWithParam`, an object's
`tintParam`, an animation's `durationParam`), so binding stays typed and testable. `expandPlan`
resolves them from `args` with defaults as fallback — which is how **`collideWith` stops being
hardcoded** and starts pointing at real plan objects. **Parameter sets** are named, reusable
argument bundles ("Tanks" → [tankA, tankB]) so a planner picks rather than re-selects.

### 18.5 Also folded in

1. Shapes/mechanics move from the toolbar into the palette as a third tab (that toolbar is full).
2. Drag-and-drop placement for attacks and shapes — drop at the cursor, as icons already do.
3. Thumbnails in the attack palette; a library has to be browsable.
4. Attack bars in the step timeline, so `startMs` is dragged rather than typed.
5. An "updated" badge when a definition changed since an instance was placed (uses `version`).
6. Copy/paste/duplicate of instances, once they're ordinary canvas citizens.

### 18.6 Stages

1. **Grouping** [DONE] — `PlanObject.groupId?`; selection expands to the whole group at the one
   choke point `select`/`toggleSelect` share, so the existing multi-node transformer moves a
   group rigidly with no new maths. Ctrl+G / Ctrl+Shift+G.
2. **Attack model v2** [DONE] — definitions entirely in -1..1 centred unit space; an instance is
   a rectangle `{x,y,w,h,rotation,startMs,args}`. `defToPlan`/`planToAttackContent` are the only
   places unit space is entered or left, so the designer kept working in pixels unchanged.
   SCHEMA_VERSION → 2, clean break.
3. **Canvas instances** [DONE] — one invisible frame per instance is the click/drag/transform
   target and what the Transformer attaches to; the drawn parts stay absolute and inert so the
   WebM exporter can still drive them by id.
4. **Palette** [DONE] — Attacks and Shapes tabs with drag-drop; attack thumbnails are the
   definition drawn into a `-1 -1 2 2` viewBox. Shapes left the toolbar; Tether stayed, being an
   operation on a selection.
5. **Parameters** [DONE] — declared on the def, answered per instance, read through typed slots
   (`collideWith`/`durationMs`/`tint`). A *bound* collideWith names plan objects, so those ids
   are used as given rather than namespaced. **Still open: reusable parameter *sets*** (named
   bundles like "Tanks" → [tankA, tankB]).
6. **Timeline bars** [DONE] — a placed attack gets a bar at `startMs`, as long as its definition
   runs, dragged or arrow-keyed like an animation. The right edge **stretches** it: an instance
   `durationMs` scales the whole bundle, so a 1000ms attack pulled to 2000ms plays exactly as
   authored at half speed. (Originally specced without a duration handle, on the grounds that an
   attack's length belongs to its definition — which is still true: stretching doesn't edit the
   definition, and an instance that has never been stretched keeps following it.)

Net effect: the attacks panel has **no number boxes left** — the palette places, the canvas
positions and sizes, the timeline says when, and the panel carries only the arguments the
definition asked the plan for.

### 18.7 Corrections after first real use

Three things the first hands-on pass found, each a hole in §18.2–18.3 rather than a slip:

1. **Attacks were invisible during playback.** Parts are materialised hidden (that's what keeps
   them off neighbouring steps) and nothing tweens `visible`, so without an entrance an attack
   played out unseen; and `ObjectNode` unmounted hidden objects, leaving GSAP nothing to find by
   id. Now: parts without an entrance get an implicit `appear` when the attack fires, and hidden
   objects keep their node (`visible={false}`). While there, a def's internal trigger chain is
   flattened onto absolute delays as it joins its host step, so an attack can't chain off the
   plan's own animations and `startMs` shifts it exactly once. The pure timing model moved to
   `@raidplan/shared` so expansion and the player share one implementation. [DONE]
2. **The instance rectangle wasn't the attack's bounding box.** Unit space is now pinned to the
   attack's own extent (`attackContentBox`, measured across base + end state + motion paths), and
   expansion maps *that* onto the rect — so old definitions self-correct too. Saving from the
   designer shrink-wraps to match and measures `defaultSize`, which deletes the hand-typed size
   boxes; the designer draws the box instead. [DONE]
3. **An attack alone on a plan didn't count as content.** Autosave (local and remote) and undo
   each compared their own hand-written list of document slices, none of which had heard of
   `attacks` — so a plan whose only content was an attack never saved, and everything downstream
   (reload, viewer, share preview) saw an empty plan. The slices are now named once, as a *total*
   record over `PlanDoc`, so the next field added to the document is a compile error rather than
   a plan that silently stops saving. Counts include attacks, a duplicated step brings its
   attacks, and deleting an object drops it from any attack argument naming it. [DONE]
4. **An attack couldn't be placed from the base layout.** Placement is a property of the board,
   firing is a property of one step — so instances moved from `Step.attacks` to `Plan.attacks`,
   each carrying `stepId`. Placing from the base layout pins the attack to the first step,
   creating one if the plan has none. The canvas shows every attack, dimming the ones that fire
   elsewhere; the panel says which step fires each. SCHEMA_VERSION → 3, clean break. [DONE]

---

*End of plan. Suggested next actions: (a) confirm the three key decisions in §2, then (b) scaffold Phase 0–1, or (c) turn this document into a checklist/issue tracker.*

### 18.8 Parameters, made legible

The mechanism worked; nothing explained it, so it read as a dead end. A parameter has **two**
halves — declare it, then point it at something inside the attack — and only the first was
visible. Now: the panel says what a parameter is and what the plan will be asked for; binding
targets read `move · Cone` rather than `move`, which is unusable the moment an attack has three
moves; an unbound parameter, a type nothing can read (`text`/`boolean`), and "no animation to
drive yet" each say so where the control would be. The e2e authors a parameter, binds it, saves,
reopens to prove the binding survived, and then ticks a plan object for it in a plan — the whole
loop in one test. [DONE]
